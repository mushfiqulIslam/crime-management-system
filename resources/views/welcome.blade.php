    <p class="w3-justify">Now-a-days everything is getting computerized
except for crime management. We can see public
who wish to complain go to the police station and
file a complaint. Police maintain these
complaints and FIRs and several other files
manually. This software addresses these
problems by letting public complain online and
computerized management of these complaints
along with maintaining records of FIR,
Unidentified Dead bodies, Post Mortem, Patrol,
Criminals, Most Wanted Criminals etc. for
police. This saves a lot of time of both police and
public. This software is mainly developed for
Mangalore citizens and it is a joint operation of
police stations of different regions of Mangalore
with the intention of making the city crime free.</p>
